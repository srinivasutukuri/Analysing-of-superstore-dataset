# Analysing-of-superstore-dataset
Here this project explains mindset of the analyst while doing the analysis, for the analytics we need few steps like: 

Step1: - understand the data 

Step2: - Raise the questions 

Why only 6% of sales account for the 89 % loss of the store?  

Why Out of 9994 sales, 81.17% (8113) of them account for only 32% of the total sales amount, which is equal to $738,699.56.? 

These are the major questions I got while researching the answer for these questions some other sub questions also generated. 

Step3: - solving of the questions 

We solved 70 % of this question Why only 6% of sales account for the 89 % loss of the store? 

I already discuss that in the abnormal loss of $140327.3647 only 64% loss cases due above 50% discount. 

Out of 9994 sales, only 12.77% (1277) of them are not have any loss, these sales have the discounts for 0% to 40% only, that means the discount above 50% are mostly affecting to loss. 

The reason behind saying only 70% question is solved is   in the 6% sales 15% and 20% discounts also causing to loss, this point also researchable. 

 

Step4: - Make recommendations 

In the dataset 30% and 40% discount is causing for loss and gain, this means 30% and 40% is applicable for some products and not applicable for some products.  We should find those products. 

To remove Above 50% discount strongly recommended. 

Note: - In this blog I mention basic analysis, if I mention all it will become a above 20 pages report. Which makes difficult to read for beginners.  this may be enough for overview of the analytics; we need to do experiments with standard techniques and custom techniques (which can make with our experience).  

 

Power-Bi: -  

                  There is no use to analyzing and finding hidden patterns in data and making recommendations mean while we not explain about those hidden patterns and recommendations to client. Power-Bi makes its easy by assessing as to make dashboards. Dashboards are combination of charts, tables, filters, cards, maps which are created by us for results what we get in the analysis, I called as data story telling.
